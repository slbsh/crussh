## SSH Chat Thing
crussh - **C**hat **Ru**st **SSH** (cause we're using `russh`) ayy  
change name later mayhaps?  

Chat server for the beeps and the boops. All over ssh, no special client needed.  
Nets us encryption, key exchange, and authentication out of the box :)  

Basically a slightly more sofisticated and stable IRC... buut the client and server are the same thing.  
 
Eventually this thing's gonna have chat history (together with ann encrypted option), file transfer (sftp), image previews (smth like catimg), and key authentication.

## TODO
- serialize state, store it, and sync file with program in the background
- implement channel user list
- implement chat history
